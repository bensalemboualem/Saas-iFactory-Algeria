## 🚀 MINDSET & EXECUTION

### Key Principles

1. **Start Small, Think Big**
   - Launch with 1 free + 1 paid course first
   - Validate market demand
   - Scale what works

2. **Default to Action**
   - Don't wait for perfection
   - 80% done today > 100% done never
   - Get feedback from real students

3. **Focus on Unit Economics**
   - Track cost per customer
   - Track revenue per customer
   - If LTV > 5x CAC, scale ads
   - If not, optimize before scaling

4. **Build in Public**
   - Share your journey on Twitter
   - Show progress honestly
   - Build community around growth
   - People buy from builders they trust

5. **Listen to Students**
   - Your best feedback is from customers
   - Weekly: Read all testimonials
   - Monthly: Survey students
   - Iterate on top feedback

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

❌ **Perfectionism:** Don't re-record courses 10 times
✅ **Launch with 80% quality, improve based on feedback**

❌ **Ignoring metrics:** Don't guess what's working
✅ **Track everything, optimize based on data**

❌ **Spending too much too fast:** Don't spend 100K on ads before validating
✅ **Start with 500 CHF, scale as ROI improves**

❌ **Isolation:** Don't work alone without feedback
✅ **Share progress, get feedback, iterate publicly**

❌ **Giving up too early:** Don't quit if Week 2 is slow
✅ **Give it 4 weeks minimum to see real results**
